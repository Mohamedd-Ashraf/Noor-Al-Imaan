  Prevents the Android resource shrinker from removing adhan audio files.
  These files are referenced dynamically via resources.getIdentifier(soundName, "raw", packageName)
  which bypasses static analysis. Without this file, the shrinker removes adhan_2.mp3–adhan_10.mp3
  in release builds because they appear "unreferenced".
